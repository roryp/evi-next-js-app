# Hear the Hidden: AI-Powered Sarcasm Detection

## Introduction

Sarcasm is a fundamental aspect of human communication that conveys complex emotional states. Yet, for many individuals—particularly those with neurodivergent conditions—detecting sarcasm can be a significant barrier to meaningful interaction.

This project bridges that gap by leveraging AI technology to detect sarcastic speech patterns through emotion analysis, creating more inclusive communication environments for everyone.

> 🔍 **Example:** "I'm so glad we picked the perfect day for a picnic — just like you said, no chance of rain!"  
> When it's pouring rain, the contradiction between positive words and negative context creates sarcasm.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js** framework for a responsive, performant web application
- **Hume's Empathic Voice Interface** for sophisticated emotion recognition
- **Custom emotion pattern recognition algorithms** for sarcasm detection
- **Real-time audio and visual analysis** for multimodal input processing
- **Configurable detection parameters** for personalized experiences

## Features

### Sarcasm Detector
Analyze speech in real-time to identify sarcastic patterns through:
- Emotion pattern recognition
- Contextual analysis
- Multimodal processing (voice, facial expressions, text)

### Sarcasm Creator
Learn how sarcasm is constructed through:
- Interactive pattern generation
- Emotional component visualization
- Pattern breakdown and explanation

### Customizable Parameters
Fine-tune the detection algorithm with:
- Adjustable emotion thresholds
- Pattern weight customization
- Real-time configuration updates

## How It Works

The sarcasm detection system operates through five key processes:

1. **Emotion Identification**: Detecting key sarcasm indicators like amusement, contempt, and disappointment
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Analyzing emotional combinations that signal sarcasm
3. **Contextual Analysis**: Evaluating emotional complexity and contradictions
4. **Threshold Application**: Scoring patterns against configurable thresholds
5. **Feedback Presentation**: Providing detailed breakdown of detected sarcasm

## Accessibility Benefits

- **Enhanced Communication**: Real-time feedback on emotional context
- **Support for Neurodivergent Users**: Explicit cues that clarify speaker intent
- **Educational Applications**: Safe practice for improving social communication skills
- **Inclusive Design**: Adjustable settings for different user needs
