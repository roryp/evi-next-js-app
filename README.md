# Hear the Hidden: AI-Powered Sarcasm Detection

## Introduction

Sarcasm is a fundamental aspect of human communication that conveys complex emotional states. Yet, for many individuals—particularly those with neurodivergent conditions—detecting sarcasm can be a significant barrier to meaningful interaction.

This project bridges that gap by leveraging AI technology to detect sarcastic speech patterns through emotion analysis, creating more inclusive communication environments for everyone.

## Overview

This application includes several AI-powered sarcasm features:

1. **Sarcasm Detection**: A sophisticated system that analyzes emotional signals from Hume's Empathic Voice Interface to detect even subtle forms of sarcasm with high accuracy.

2. **Sarcasm Creator**: A text generator that crafts sarcastic responses based on input text, with customizable sarcasm styles and tone settings.

3. **Sarcasm Voice Generator**: A text-to-speech feature that converts text into spoken audio with sarcastic intonation, using customizable voice options.

These tools combine to create a comprehensive suite for understanding, creating, and vocalizing sarcastic communication.

### How It Works

The sarcasm detection system operates by:

1. **Identifying key sarcasm indicators**: The algorithm looks for specific emotions that often indicate sarcasm, including:
   - Amusement
   - Contempt
   - Disappointment
   - Awkwardness
   - Realization
   - Surprise (negative)
   - Doubt
   - Confusion
   - Anger

2. **Analyzing misleading emotions**: It evaluates potentially misleading emotions that might appear high during sarcastic speech:
   - Excitement
   - Joy
   - Satisfaction
   - Pride
   - Interest
   - Determination
   - Surprise (positive)

3. **Pattern recognition**: The system looks for specific patterns associated with sarcasm:
   - Amusement combined with contempt
   - Exaggerated positive emotions (very high excitement/joy)
   - Positive emotions with negative undertones
   - Multiple contrasting emotions present simultaneously
   - Anger alongside positive emotions
   - High single emotion with very few supporting emotions

4. **Contextual analysis**: The algorithm considers the emotional complexity and contradictions:
   - Multiple high emotions indicating complexity
   - Lack of dominant emotion
   - Contradiction between positive and negative emotions

5. **Threshold application**: Sarcasm is reported to the user when the computed score exceeds a threshold value.

### Interactive Tooltip

The sarcasm detection feature includes an interactive tooltip that provides detailed information about detected sarcasm:

- **Hover functionality**: Users can hover over the sarcasm indicator to see what factors contributed to the sarcasm detection
- **Contribution breakdown**: The tooltip displays specific patterns that were detected, how much each contributed to the overall score, and detailed explanations of why each pattern suggests sarcasm
- **Visual indicators**: Emotions that contributed to sarcasm detection are marked with a checkmark (✓) in the emotion display

### Customizable Sarcasm Parameters

The application includes a comprehensive sarcasm configuration system that allows fine-tuning of the sarcasm detection algorithm:

- **Pattern weight customization**: Each sarcasm detection pattern can be:
  - Enabled or disabled based on user preference
  - Adjusted for sensitivity with custom weight values
  - Reviewed through detailed descriptions explaining the pattern's significance

- **Threshold adjustments**: Users can modify key thresholds including:
  - Detection threshold (minimum score required to report sarcasm)
  - Strong indicator threshold (sensitivity for individual emotion signals)
  - Base indicator thresholds for different emotion categories

- **Real-time updates**: Configuration changes take effect immediately across the application
  - Parameters are shared via React Context to ensure consistent detection
  - The Messages component receives updated parameters automatically

- **Reset functionality**: Users can easily restore default parameter values

### Context Integration

The sarcasm configuration is seamlessly integrated with the Messages component:

- **Context-aware emotion analysis**: The Messages component accesses sarcasm parameters via React Context
- **Per-message application**: Each message independently evaluates sarcasm using the current parameters
- **Consistent UI experience**: Parameter changes affect all displayed messages consistently
- **Efficient rendering**: Only relevant components re-render when parameters change

### Sarcasm Detection Table

The following table showcases some key emotions and patterns evaluated by the sarcasm detection system:

| Pattern | Impact | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Amusement + Contempt | High | A classic sarcasm pattern combining humor with disdain |
| Exaggerated positive emotion | High | Unusually high excitement/joy that may indicate sarcastic exaggeration |
| Contrasting emotions | Very High | Simultaneous positive and negative emotions, a strong indicator of sarcasm |
| Anger + Positive emotion | High | Combination signals passive-aggressive sarcasm |
| Positive emotion + Negative undertones | Very High | Excitement with underlying negative emotions is a classic sarcasm pattern |
| Multiple sarcasm indicators | Medium | Multiple sarcasm-related emotions detected simultaneously |
| No dominant emotion | Low | Lack of clear emotional signals may suggest mixed or masked intent |

This enhanced algorithm provides real-time feedback on potential sarcasm detection, helping the EVI understand nuanced emotional contexts in conversations. The tooltip functionality adds transparency, allowing users to understand why certain statements were flagged as potentially sarcastic.

### Running the Docker Image Locally

To build and run the Docker image locally, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker Image with Docker Secrets (Recommended)**:
   
   The Dockerfile is configured to use Docker secrets for secure handling of API keys:

   ```bash
   # For Linux/macOS
   docker build \
     --secret id=openai_key,src=openai_api_key.txt \
     --secret id=hume_key,src=hume_api_key.txt \
     --secret id=hume_secret,src=hume_secret_key.txt \
     -t evi-next-js-app .
   ```

   On Windows PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   docker build `
     --secret id=openai_key,src=openai_api_key.txt `
     --secret id=hume_key,src=hume_api_key.txt `
     --secret id=hume_secret,src=hume_secret_key.txt `
     -t evi-next-js-app .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:

   ```bash
   # For Linux/macOS
   docker run -p 3000:3000 \
     -e OPENAI_API_KEY="$(cat openai_api_key.txt)" \
     -e HUME_API_KEY="$(cat hume_api_key.txt)" \
     -e HUME_SECRET_KEY="$(cat hume_secret_key.txt)" \
     evi-next-js-app
   ```

   On Windows PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   docker run -p 3000:3000 `
     -e OPENAI_API_KEY="$(Get-Content openai_api_key.txt)" `
     -e HUME_API_KEY="$(Get-Content hume_api_key.txt)" `
     -e HUME_SECRET_KEY="$(Get-Content hume_secret_key.txt)" `
     evi-next-js-app
   ```

   This will start the Docker container and map port 3000 of the container to port 3000 on your local machine. You can then access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### In Production Environments

For production deployments, instead of using local files, you should use your deployment platform's secret management system:

1. Store your API keys in your cloud provider's secret manager (Azure KeyVault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
2. Inject the secrets at build time using your CI/CD pipeline
3. Configure environment variables for runtime in your deployment configuration

For example, in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Build Docker image with secrets
        run: |
          echo "${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}" > openai_key.txt
          echo "${{ secrets.HUME_API_KEY }}" > hume_key.txt
          echo "${{ secrets.HUME_SECRET_KEY }}" > hume_secret.txt
          
          docker build \
            --secret id=openai_key,src=openai_key.txt \
            --secret id=hume_key,src=hume_key.txt \
            --secret id=hume_secret,src=hume_secret.txt \
            -t myapp:latest .
            
          # Clean up temporary files
          rm openai_key.txt hume_key.txt hume_secret.txt
```
